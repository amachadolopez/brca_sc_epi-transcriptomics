    <title>Characterization of breast cancer at the single cell level using transcriptomic and epigenomic data</title> 
  </head> 
  <body> 
    <p> This project is the final thesis of my master's degree in bioinformatics and biostatistics at Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC). This is a reanalysis of the wonderful work done by [Grosselin et al, 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31152164/9), where I will try to characterize single cell data at transcriptomic and epigenomic level, to try to identify biologically-relevant characteristics or differences between breast cancer subtypes (luminal vs triple negative) or drug-responsiveness (sensitive vs resistant). 

So far the work is organized in different Rmd files:

- brca_sc_transcriptomics: Characterization of single cell transcriptomic data (QC, integration, clustering and cell annotation). You can also check the report <a href="brca_transcriptomics.html">here</a> 

- brca_sc_epigenomics: Characterization of single cell H3K27me3 data (QC, integration, clustering and cell annotation).

- comparative_analysis_scRNA: Comparison between different models in terms of cell type abundance and expression.

- comparative_analysis_scChIPseq: Comparison between different models in terms of H3K27me3 profiles.
